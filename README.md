# BitzAPI
This is not one of my most organized projects, but BitzAPI has some cool features and it has more on the way.

There is not one goal with BitzAPI. It has many utilities, but one of the most prominent is the command system. It allows you to easily create commands in a tree-like system. This library is far from prefect, but I've been working on it recently and I AM improving it.

## Plans
- [ ] A new command system using lambdas ([partially completed](https://github.com/Rayzr522/BitzAPI/blob/master/src/main/java/com/rayzr522/bitzapi/testcommands/Command.java))
- [ ] Bridging the gap between code and config files with dynamic data classes (a very messy implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Rayzr522/TestEnv/blob/master/src/com/rayzr522/testenv/PlayerData.java) and then [here](https://github.com/Rayzr522/TestEnv/blob/master/src/com/rayzr522/testenv/Main.java#L35-L69))
- [ ] Create a simple to use Menu system for creating dynamic GUI menus
- [ ] \(Possibly\) A natural language processing system allowing the easy setup of natural language systems. The implementation will only be in English (at least at first, but adding support for more languages will be... painful)
